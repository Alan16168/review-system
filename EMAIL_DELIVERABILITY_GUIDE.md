- Added email headers for better reputation
- Improved email subject line
- Added clear footer with unsubscribe context
- Included support contact information

## How to Improve Email Deliverability

### Short-term Actions (Do Now)

#### 1. Add DMARC Policy (If Not Already Done)
DMARC tells email providers how to handle emails that fail authentication.

**Add this DNS record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@ireviewsystem.com; pct=100; adkim=s; aspf=s
TTL: 3600
```

**Explanation:**
- `p=quarantine`: Ask receivers to mark suspicious emails as spam
- `rua`: Send reports to this address
- `pct=100`: Apply policy to 100% of emails
- `adkim=s`: Strict DKIM alignment
- `aspf=s`: Strict SPF alignment

#### 2. Warm Up Your Domain
New domains have no sending reputation. Start slow:
- **Week 1**: Send 10-20 emails per day
- **Week 2**: Send 50-100 emails per day
- **Week 3**: Send 200-500 emails per day
- **Week 4+**: Gradually increase to normal volume

#### 3. Ask Users to Whitelist Your Email
When users register, show them a message:
> "To ensure you receive important emails from us, please add noreply@ireviewsystem.com to your contacts or mark our emails as 'Not Spam'."

### Medium-term Actions (This Week)

#### 1. Set Up Custom Tracking Domain (Optional)
This prevents your links from being flagged as suspicious.

**In Resend Dashboard:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Tracking Domain
2. Add: `track.ireviewsystem.com`
3. Add DNS CNAME record provided by Resend

#### 2. Monitor Email Reputation
Use these tools to check your domain reputation:
- Google Postmaster Tools: https://postmaster.google.com
- Microsoft SNDS: https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/
- SenderScore: https://senderscore.org

#### 3. Add Unsubscribe Link
Even for transactional emails, having an unsubscribe option improves trust.

**Already done in code:**
```javascript
headers: {
  'List-Unsubscribe': '<mailto:unsubscribe@ireviewsystem.com>',
}
```

### Long-term Actions (Next Month)

#### 1. Get Feedback Loop Data
Sign up for feedback loops with major providers:
- Gmail: Via Google Postmaster Tools
- Outlook/Hotmail: https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com
- Yahoo: https://senders.yahooinc.com/

#### 2. Monitor Bounce Rates
High bounce rates damage reputation. Keep it under 2%.

**Resend automatically tracks this:**
- Check: https://resend.com/emails
- Filter by "Bounced" status

#### 3. Implement Email Preference Center
Let users control what emails they receive:
- Password resets (cannot unsubscribe)
- Notifications (can customize)
- Marketing (can unsubscribe)

## Immediate Testing Actions

### Test 1: Mark as "Not Spam"
Ask your test users to:
1. Check spam folder for the password reset email
2. Click "Not Spam" / "Report Not Spam"
3. Move email to inbox
4. Add sender to contacts

This trains the email provider that your emails are legitimate.

### Test 2: Monitor Resend Logs
1. Go to: https://resend.com/emails
2. Check delivery status
3. Look for any bounces or complaints
4. Click on email to see detailed logs

### Test 3: Check Email Headers
When you receive an email in spam:
1. Open the email
2. View "Show Original" / "View Source"
3. Look for these headers:
   - `SPF: PASS`
   - `DKIM: PASS`
   - `DMARC: PASS`

If any fail, there's a DNS configuration issue.
